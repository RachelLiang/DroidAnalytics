This is the linux version of DroidAnalytics. 

The system is based on the paper: 

Min Zheng, Mingshen Sun, John C. S. Lui
"DroidAnalytics: A Signature Based Analytic System to Collect, Extract, Analyze and Associate Android Malware"
Proceedings of The 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom 13), Melbourne, Australia, July 2013.

Now I am rewriting DroidAnalytics using Python.

It has those features:

1. Signature generation (finished).

2. Similarity measurement (future work).

3. Zero-day malware detection (future work).

4. Feature extraction (future work).
